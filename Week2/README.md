EE PMP 590 Spring 2014 - Week2
=====

This repository contains sample code, lectures slides, and homework requirements for Week 2.

* Inside of `SampleCode`, you will find three projects, `CppThread`, `FFTWSample`, and `XNA_audio`.  Each is a self-contained Visual Studio solution, containing the result of the live demos done in class on Monday, and an example project showing how to use the included FFTW library for Homework 2.

* Inside of `Homework`, you will find the homework requirements file for Homework 2.  For a template of Homework 2 to fork, complete, and submit, take a look at [this repository](https://github.com/EE590-Spring2014/Homework2).  A `.zip` file of your fork of that repository is what should be submitted to [the dropbox](https://catalyst.uw.edu/collectit/dropbox/sabae/31315).

* Inside of `Slides` is a `.pptx` containing the slides shown in Lecture on Monday.

If any errors are found, bugs in code, etc., please [open an issue on this repository](https://github.com/EE590-Spring2014/Materials/issues/new) if it relates to the content here, or if there is a bug in the homework template [open an issue on the homework repository](https://github.com/EE590-Spring2014/Homework2/issues/new).
